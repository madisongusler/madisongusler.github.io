  		<p>When Amazon introduced Kindle to the world, it gave readers easy, cheap access to a seemingly unlimited catalog of e-books. This changed the world of publishing.</p>
  		<br> 
  		<p>Traditional publishing houses, independent sellers, brick-and mortar bookstores; the entire literary industry was on the edge of their seats. The previously reliable industry was now largely unstable, with <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/01/will-amazon-kill-publishing/252218/#">reporters expecting</a> a downward trajectory coming to the world of print.</p>
  		<br>
  		<p>This significant change altered the publishing environment forever.</p>
  		<br>
  		<p>E-books have <a href="https://www.wicksonlibrary.org/post/changes-in-reading-habits-during-the-pandemic">risen in popularity</a>. More books are released online before going to print, giving readers <a href="https://medium.com/the-business-of-writing/how-authors-get-paid-in-kindle-unlimited-efbec9facac4">direct access to content</a> without perusing the bookshelves.  <a href="https://medium.com/the-business-of-writing/how-authors-get-paid-in-kindle-unlimited-efbec9facac4">Readers' interests</a> and internet histories are used to provide suggestions for users to read next. Books have become more affordable through online sale platforms, providing an alternative to traditional hardcover book releases. Some platforms and authors even chose to provide public access to their work, using free platforms to publish their projects without a paywall.</p>
  		<br>
  		<p>This increased access to content without premium fees was a major factor in the closing of physical bookstores. Barnes & Nobles and indie bookstores, who couldn’t compete with Amazon and other platforms, were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/12/business/media/barnes-noble-leonard-riggio.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare">struggling</a> to make profit.</p>
  		<br>
  		<p>This has recently changed. As a result of <a href="https://readingagency.org.uk/news/media/new-survey-says-reading-connects-a-nation-in-lockdown.html">pandemic inspired reading habits</a> and the rise of the <a href="https://amp.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/06/i-cant-stress-how-much-booktok-sells-teen-literary-influencers-swaying-publishers">#BookTok community</a>, the publishing world has seen consistent market increases.</p>
  		<br>
  		<p>The vast online community is responsible for creating bestsellers, popularizing authors, and reigniting a love of all the ‘book-ish things’ for the next generation. According to data from <a href="https://wordsrated.com/booktok-statistics/">WordsRated</a>, the average American TikTok user is reading 60% more books after being exposed to #BookTok.</p>
  		<br>
  		<p>The #BookTok community has had numerous positive impacts on the world of publishing; from increasing sales on <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/bookselling/article/87304-how-tiktok-makes-backlist-books-into-bestsellers.html">backlogged books</a> and <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/booktok-tiktok-creator-publishing-1234649819/amp/">promoting diverse authors</a>, to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/donations-pour-asian-american-owned-nyc-bookstore-decimated-fire-rcna93144">saving small local book stores</a> from closing.</p>

  		<br>
  		<p>But there is a dark side to the community as well. TikTok users have become critics of authors and each other, <a href="https://businessreview.berkeley.edu/booktok-when-tiktok-met-the-book-industry/">judging others'</a> reading habits, calling authors out for writing choices and questioning standards of the publishing industry (which honestly, may not be such a bad thing).</p>
 		<br>
  		<br>
  		<p>The #Booktok community, which emerged as a place to recommend good books and share a love of reading together, has become a community focused on <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jennmcmillen/2023/01/22/can-booktok-save-bookstores-read-between-the-lines/amp/">consumerism</a>. Users are <a href="https://www.insider.com/ill-never-go-back-to-booktok-after-getting-library-card-2023-6">buying</a> and reading books at an unsustainable rate in an effort to maintain popularity and influence on the platform. Creating book hauls for their followers and bragging about reading over 200 books a year, this gains them a platform but creates a difficult lifestyle to maintain.</p>
  		<br>
  		<p>I know this because, like many other book lovers on the platform, it's something I have experienced.</p>
		<br>
  		<p>Since becoming part of the #BookTok community in 2020, I’ve reignited my love for reading that seemed to die out in high school. I began spending large sums of money at Barnes & Noble without blinking an eye.</p> 
  		<br>
  		<p>In 2021, I started tracking my reading habits and on average I read 126 books a year. I can not afford 126 books a year.</p>
  		<br>
  		<p>The majority of my reading is a leisurely activity. More than 72% of the books I read each year I would consider to be romance novels. I have read four books with some version of “Blind Side” in their title. In the last three years, I’ve only read 8 nonfiction books.</p>
  		<br>
  		<p>I am not learning or growing much as a person from maintaining this pattern of reading, so I can reason there is no cost-benefit in continuing this habit.</p>
  		<br>
  		<p>So, like many others, I turned to technology for a cheap solution to my reading habits. #BookTok introduced me to the platform <a href="https://z-lib.is/">Z-Library</a> or Z-Lib, a website offering users free access to a massive catalog of pirated e-books. This was an extremely <a href="https://huntnewsnu.com/69818/lifestyle/z-library-shutdown-leaves-users-scrambling-to-find-alternatives/#:~:text=Although%20the%20website%20helped%20its,arrested%20and%20charged%20in%20Argentina.">helpful tool for university students</a> as it included textbooks and academic journals, alongside a wide collection of fiction and fantasy.</p>
  		<br>
  		<p>With access to free books, readers are able to enjoy and consume whatever books or genres they want without any financial, personal or political limitations that may exist. But there are many ethical questions that arise when these practices become commonplace.</p>
  		<br>
 		<p>Is this undercutting the author's income? If yes, is it worth actively trying to prevent book pirating? It is <a href="https://authorsguild.org/app/uploads/2023/03/2022-Authors-Guild-Annual-Report.pdf">illegal to share copyrighted material</a> without proper attribution, but is limiting access to important resources, such as expensive textbooks, the right answer? Is there a way to find a balance in this market, or will we never change, just continue to evolve book pirating options?</p>
 		<br>
 		<p>I ask these questions after Z-lib has already been <a href="https://www.siliconrepublic.com/business/z-library-shut-down-digital-books">taken down by the FBI</a> near the end of 2022, after <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/11/17/fbi-takeover-zlibrary-booktok-impacted/">more than 10 years</a> on the internet. The government <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/u-s-authorities-seize-z-library-domain-names-221104/">seizing all related domains</a> caused <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/11/17/fbi-takeover-zlibrary-booktok-impacted/">much controversy</a> in the #BookTok space.</p>
 		<br>
 		<p>And while every reader and their financial situation is different, I think we are capable of change.</p>
 		<br>
  		<p>With time and actively increasing public awareness of resources already available to readers, ones which contribute to authors' financial and literary success, this can be done.</p>
  		<br>
  		<p>To see this pattern, I looked at my own reading habits as a case study.</p>
  	</div>

  	<div id="chart">
		<iframe title="How I Access Books" aria-label="Grouped Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-MzgRb" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/MzgRb/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="550" height="448" data-external="1"></iframe>
	</div>

  	<div class="text">
  		<br>
 		<p>I currently have over 350 books in my room. I have access to two libraries in person and on the Libby app. I still read a large number of books by pirating them.</p>
 		<br>
  		<p>Why do I pirate books, especially when I have many unread books at home? There’s a wide range of reasons, the largest being that as I explained earlier, I can not mindfully afford or justify the cost to maintain my reading habits.</p>
  		<br>
  		<p>BookTok creates this desire to be on top of the latest reading trends. With new books releasing every day, shooting into instant popularity, it's hard to keep up.</p> 
  		<br>
  		<p>I would buy trending books, intending to read them, only to later realize I don’t enjoy the plot or the writing style, or I would opt for a newer book that I downloaded on Z-Lib.</p>
  		<br>
  		<p>I like the easy access to a catalog of free books on my phone. Compared to lugging around a hardcover fantasy novel, an e-book is much easier to carry around and squeeze in a few chapters throughout the day.</p>
  		<br>
  		<p>But with conscious effort, over the last three years I have decreased the number of pirated books I read by 61%.</p>
  		<br>
  		<p>The most valuable tool I used to achieve this is my library card.</p>

  		<br>
  		<p>I am a card holder for the New York Public Library and the Long Beach Public Library, where I worked as the Social Media Marketing Manager. In my job, I marketed our library's resources, helping our community access the amazing tools available to them.</p>
  		<br>
  		<p>This includes Libby, my number one recommendation for all book lovers.</p>
  		<br>
  		<p>Libby has given me access to more than e-books. I can read graphic novels, manga, listen to audiobooks and music, or watch educational videos for free with my account.</p>
  		<br>
 		<p>While it doesn’t have the same immediate access to content as websites like Z-lib, this reading method pays authors fairly for access to their licensed work. Z-lib <a href="https://authorsguild.org/news/federal-law-enforcement-indicts-z-library-operators-with-ag-assistance/">caused harm</a> to many authors who depend on book sales to make a living. I feel it’s worth waiting a bit longer for your book when the process adequately compensates the author.</p>
 		<br>
  		<p>Supporting authors financially is the best option, it helps develop their career and allows them the opportunity to write. They put a lot of hard work into creating a product you enjoy, and deserve to be paid for their time.</p>
  		<br>
  		<p>Using your Libby account also helps support your local library, an amazing public resource with much more than free physical books for patrons to access.</p>
  		<br>
  		<p>Do I still pirate reading material? Yes, there are some novels I can’t access on Libby or the library.</p>
  		<br>
  		<p>I recognize that for many pirating is the best option available. Especially in locations where libraries are hard to access or collections are limited by state legislation.</p>
  		<br>
  		<p>When this is the case, I suggest finding alternative ways to support authors. This includes recommending them to other readers or leaving positive reviews on Goodreads. I will engage with an author's social media content, increasing their presence in the algorithm, hoping the next reader is in a position to purchase the book.</p>
  		<br>
  		<p>I don’t think you need to buy every book you’ve ever read. If you’re anything like me, that's just not affordable.</p>
  		<br>
  		<p>But you can do right by authors and support them when and where you can, whether that’s financially or socially. Do what works best for you and your needs, while also keeping authors in mind.</p>
